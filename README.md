# Lathe_RPM_Display

See project on YouTube: https://youtu.be/7gDZs0bImr0
I bought a wood lathe a few months ago and I thought it would be fun to make my own digital readout. 
The plan for this project was to use a hall effect sensor and a neodymium magnet to sense the rotations of the lathe spindle. 
I used an arduino board to read the sensor, count the pulses, and calculate the RPM of the spindle. 
I used seven segment displays to show the RPM reading. I designed a PCB and 3D printed an enclosure.
